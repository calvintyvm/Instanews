## InstaNews
One-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via the New York Times API.


This site will be useful for anyone who wants to read the news quickly and efficiently, with a click of a button, 12 top stories including images will appear. 

For this project, I used HTML, JS (Jqeury), CSS (SASS) and Gulp.

This project was really fun and neat as I learned many cool things such as API and how powerful it can be just from a click of a button. 

I hope to learn more API in the future.
